# YouTube player on Electron

`npm i`

Be patient, Electron is quite a huge package (up to 2 minutes in my case).

`npm start`

Opens the Home screen. Process will be closed if you close the window.

Use the *Player* field to open a player.

Use the *Live Chat* field to open a video's chat.

All app windows are *Always On Top*.
