# YouTube player on Electron

`npm i`

Be patient, Electron is quite a huge package (up to 2 minutes in my case).

`npm start`

Opens the app window. Process will be closed if you close the window, or when you click `X` button in the app.

Put an URL to the video or its ID in the upper input and press `Enter`/`Return` (it'll parse URLs for video or video in playlist to get the ID).

`X` button for closeing the window.

Grey buttons on top-left and top-right corners are **for moving** the window.
